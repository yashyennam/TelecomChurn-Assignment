# TelecomChurn-Assignment

# Problem Statement

In the telecommunication industry, customers tend to change operators if not provided with attractive schemes and offers. It is very important for any telecom operator to prevent the present customers from churning to other operators. As a data scientist, your task in this case study would be to build an ML model which can predict if the customer will churn or not in a particular month based on the past data.

- It will be used to predict whether a high-value customer will churn or not, in near future (i.e. churn phase). By knowing this, the company can take action steps such as providing special plans, discounts on recharge etc.

- It will be used to identify important variables that are strong predictors of churn. These variables may also indicate why customers choose to switch to other networks.
